# mw2jekyll

A MediaWiki MySQL database to Jekyll Git repository conversion tool.

## Usage notes

This script initializes a bare repository.  To initialize into a normal repository, use /path/to/repo/.git

The script will prompt you to install any missing required gems, however you must install [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) manually.
